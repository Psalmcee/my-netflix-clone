# **Netflix-clone-app**

## **This is a clone version of the Netflix web App built using React and pure CSS**

## Overview
This is my first react project where I exercised my profound skills and knowledge of React to create a clone version of an interactive web application such as Netflix. 

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) Website which interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data received through API integrations. 

consumers can use the received data to work offline if needed, which makes me more convenient for users as it enables them consume fewer data resources.

This project is made possible using [REACT JS](https://reactjs.org/); A javascript library used to build different UI components of a web page in split parts.
